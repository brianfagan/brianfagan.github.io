  <p> ASU student soon to earn Bachelor of Arts and (hopefully) a Java-coding certification
 from GCU. I will have a bachelor's degree but I won't have any skills associated with it so Java is an excellent choice for me.
    I am currently taking a course on Java at ASU right now and I am dedicating a lot of extra time to the class in preporation for
    the bootcamp .Dedicated and conscientious, an effective team and
project member who joins and contributes to collaborative efforts in support
of the overall group mission and objective.</p>
