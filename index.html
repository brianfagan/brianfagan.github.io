    <p> ASU student soon to earn Bachelor of Arts degree and  a Java-coding certification.  I'm looking to bring interest and
knowledge to an entry-level programming position. Dedicated and conscientious, an effective team
and project member who joins and contributes to collaborative efforts in support of the overall group
mission and objective.  </p>
    <h2> Current Education </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Arizona State University, College of Integrative Sciences &amp; Arts
        Bachelor of Arts, General Studies (in progress)</li>
    </ul>
   
    <p>If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn't so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I'm here to help you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you're worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you won't have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!</p>
    
    <h2> Dressing for the Shows</h2>
    Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new lines. Also it's important to wear shoes you'll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but you'll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
